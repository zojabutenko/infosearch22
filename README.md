# infosearch22

## Contents:
3 homeworks and a project

## Project:
The website is Flask + HTML + CSS (Bootstrap).

Directory models: models used for search (BERT, TF-IDF, BM25).

Files with matrices that are too big for GitHub (>25MB) are archived and would need to be unarchived first.

In the case of BERT, the file is too large even archived, so it was split into several archives using the *split* command on MacOS, so it could be difficult to unarchive from a different OS.
